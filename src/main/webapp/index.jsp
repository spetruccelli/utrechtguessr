        How good do you know Utrecht?<br> <br>
    </h2>

    <br> In this game your knowledge of Utrecht is tested.
    <br> You will be shown 10 pictures of locations somewhere in Utrecht.
    <br> Your task is to indicate where this picture is taken on the map shown to the right of the picture.
    <br> You can move the map and zoom in and out to try to find the correct location.
    <br> Per picture you only have one chance to indicate the location.
    <br> After you click on the map, your chosen location is shown with a green marker, and the actual location with a red marker.
    <br> The distance between these two is calculated and that determines your score.
    <br> The closer the better of course...
    <br><br> Try to get the best score!! Good luck!!!
